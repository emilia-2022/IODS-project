Reflection 1

Open the file chapter1.Rmd located in your IODS-project folder with **RStudio**. Just write some of your thoughts about this course freely in the file, e.g., How are you feeling right now? What do you expect to learn? Where did you hear about the course? \
\
Also reflect on your learning experiences with the **R for Health Data Science** book and the **Exercise Set 1**:How did it work as a "crash course" on modern R tools and using RStudio? Which were your favorite topics? Which topics were most difficult? Some other comments on the book and our new approach of
getting started with R Markdown etc.? (All this is just "warmup" to get well started and learn also the technical steps needed each week in Moodle, that is, submit and review. We will start more serious work next week! You can already look at the next topic in Moodle and begin working with the Exercise Set 2\...)
